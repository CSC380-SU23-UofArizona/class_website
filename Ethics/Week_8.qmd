## Questions for discussion

- Is it ethically acceptable for companies to present users with excessively long privacy policies, knowing that most users are unlikely to read and understand them fully?

- What ethical responsibilities do companies have in ensuring that their privacy policies are concise, clear, and easily understandable for users, even if it means additional effort and resources?

- Should there be legal regulations or industry standards mandating a maximum length for privacy policies to prevent companies from burdening users with overly complex and lengthy documents?

Elaborate.
