# Revised Schedule and Deadlines for the Course

Hi Class, 

Apologies for the falling behind schedule. As a remedial, the course plan has been updated. Please see below a revised schedule and updated deadlines. I truly appreciate your understanding and patience as we adjust the schedule to fit our course better.

### Lectures:

Starting from Monday, instead of lectures 5.1 to 5.3, I will merge the Week 5 topics with Weeks 6 and 7. This means we'll be covering all the topics, but in a more condensed manner, with only three lectures per week.

Regarding Week 4, we will conclude the lectures with the three already released: 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. On Monday, we will continue with Lecture 6.1.

Here is the updated schedule for the upcoming weeks:

| Week | Dates                            | Plan                                                       |
|------|----------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------|

| 6    | July 9 - July 15 | Data Visualization, Introduction to ML, Supervised Learning                                                  |
| 7    | July 16 - July 22| Model Assessment, Unsupervised Learning, Applications                                                        |
| 8    | July 23 - July 29| Robustness + Applied Probability and Statistics (2/2)                                                        |
| 9    | July 30 - August 5| 1 lecture on Privacy and Ethics, buffer for any further delays in lecture                                    |

| Item  | Released | Due Date | Number of Days |

| Final | On or before July 27 | August 9 | 10 days        |

Please note that I am considering extending the deadline for the final project, but the release date will be on or before July 27.

Additionally, I will be announcing Participation and Bonus Point Activities during this week.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation as we navigate through these adjustments. If you have any questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to reach out to me. 

Have a fun Sunday!
